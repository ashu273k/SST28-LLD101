/*
 * ─── LSP FIX: CsvExporter ───
 *
 * ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
 *   The old CsvExporter SILENTLY CORRUPTED data by poorly handling commas
 *   and newlines in field values. If a title had a comma, it would break
 *   the CSV structure. This WEAKENED the postcondition — the base contract
 *   promises "data faithfully represented", but CSV was losing/changing data.
 *
 * HOW WE FIXED IT:
 *   Implemented proper RFC 4180 CSV quoting:
 *   - Fields containing commas, newlines, or double-quotes are wrapped in quotes.
 *   - Internal double-quotes are escaped as "".
 *   This ensures NO DATA LOSS — honouring the base-class postcondition.
 *
 * KEY LSP POINT:
 *   The caller passes any string and gets back a valid CSV with no data loss.
 *   CsvExporter is now fully substitutable — it behaves as the base promises.
